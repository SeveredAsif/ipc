1.I will have 4 semaphores (for 4 stations) that some objects (agent class) will try to access. 
2. after locking the semaphore, they will do some dummy calculation 
3. after completing, they will notify the leader (confusion: how? idea: the leader will be set using a setLeader method that will give all of them a pointer to him. then call leader.documentDone(this.id) to pass its id to the leader). 
4. once the leader gets all of the units done message, it will go and try to write and update the log 
5. the log write read will be done using readers writers block thing 
6. CONFUSION: Within each unit, the operative holding the highest identification
number assumes leadership responsibilities, bearing ultimate accountability for the groupâ€™s success
and the safety of fellow members. -- what's the highest identification thing 
7. CONFUSION: I thought about dummy work, but what exactly is document recreation? how would i do it?


issues:
two agents - they are two struct objects - created at the start of the program. then sen to a queue or for loop or while loop -> they will never simultaneously access the same station - so wee need thread 
all of the agents will be threads and the stations will be binary semaphores

plans:
1. will create agents pthread, they will try to take their mutex locks of the corresponding stations
2. then they will do the dummy works like agent report generator , exact same way 
3. notify the leader, leader counts up 

1. 7:22 pm - 8:48 pm - first part done: assigning team, assigning leader,station work and notifying leader
2. 9:17 pm - 10:35 pm - tried the logbook reading thread - has some implementation problem
